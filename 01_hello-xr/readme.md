### Time To VR
Let's put some triangles into our Oculus headset. Loosely inspired by Mark Cerny's [Time to triangle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph8LyNIT9sg&t=162s) measurement, let's see how quickly we can get some triangles in immersive virtual reality.

We're going to keep this as simple as possible, with the goal of getting a (red) cube on the screen as quickly as possible. For art direction we'll use as our influence the supercool VR game [Superhot](https://superhotgame.com).
