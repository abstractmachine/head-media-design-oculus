### Game Engine

[Unity](https://unity.com/) is a "game engine", used for making 2D, 3D, augmented reality, and virtual reality games — as well as interactive experiences in general. Its closest competitors are the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/), and the more modest open-source project [Godot](https://godotengine.org).

Game engines are tools and/or collections of code that have been designed to make it easier to make a game than to code it on your own from scratch. Game engines have already solved all the technical basics necessary for importing and manipulating images, 3D models, animations, rigs, textures, materials, sounds, and other assets that make up your game. Game engines also solve the problem of how to develop the behavior and logic of the game, often by implementing various code-based and visual-based scripting solutions for the interactive behavior and storytelling aspects of a game.

While a game engine requires you to learn the engine itself, it shields you from much of the hassle of learning development on all the myriad platforms where you would like to install your game. Here, for example, are some of the platforms where you can deploy/distribute a game made with Unity:

- WebGL
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- iOS/iPadOS
- Android
- Playstation
- XBox
- Nintendo Switch
- Steam Deck
- Oculus
- Vive
- (...)

As you can see, the list is long and even incomplete. So the idea is that instead of having to learn each and every one of these platforms, all you need to make your game is to learn Unity and the tool will take care of the rest.

### Examples

The list of games made with Unity is almost infinite. Here are a few Unity showreels of games made with the tool, as well as the trailers for a few of the more famous games made with this tool.
