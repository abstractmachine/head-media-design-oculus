Let's start animating our cube in Unity.

### Physics | Scripts | Animation
There are many ways to get our game objects to move about in Unity. We can add physics to a game object. Or we can move an object via script using either `C#` code or via `visual scripting`. And finally, we can get our object to move using keyframe-based animations. The first two subjects will be covered in future tutorials; meaning that this tutorial is dedicated to keyframe-based animations.

### Keyframes
The concept of keyframes emergerd during the industrialisation phase of animated film production in the early 20th century. As groups of animation teams became larger and larger, allowing for more complex narratives to be produced, different roles were assigned to different types of animators. As the following documentary of Max Fleicher's studio from the 1930s explains, there are two important early stages in animated film production: (a) the creation « key pictures », and (b) the creation of « in-between drawings » which are also called « in-betweeners » or « in-betweens »:

In this type of animation, the « key » frames are the important frames at the beginning and the end of the animation sequence, as well as the key visual points that mark the peaks of various movement changes of each character and of the objects and scenery. These « key » images do not represent every frame of movement, just the *key* points of the movement. If you have these key points, you can easily fill in the gaps of images  *in-between* by simple completing the movement from point A to point B described in the key frames. So the actual image-by-image changes *in-between* these key frames are drawn by the "in-betweeners" who make sure that each step of the movement is correctly drawn so that it arrives precisely at the desired "key" frame at the end of the movement.

If you want a more detailed breakdown of how this system works, here is a YouTube video that opens with a handy chart:
